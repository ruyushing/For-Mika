Hi baby, this thing may not be do something or heal up the wounds. this may not prove my genuine love, but i just wanna give this to you.

I just wanna say sorry again for all of the things that should’ve happened. I know my pasts made you doubt my love or attraction. i am here telling you that even from the start, i did everything genuinely out of love. I want you to know that i won’t give up on us, i know you’re the one who dwell that the most. but i want you to know that i am here.

i won’t make you compete with someone else, all those love and attention i gave to you and will give to you; won’t be experienced by someone else. i wanna make you special, because you’re special. let me give you the love that you deserve hm? i love you baby
